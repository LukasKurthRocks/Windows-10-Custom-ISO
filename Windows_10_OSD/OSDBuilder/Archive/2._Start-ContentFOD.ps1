Sorry, i skipped this part. Languages "can" be added via the FOD ISO packages, but this should be done manually and not pre-ISO.
It took me way to long to get files that COULD work. I'll not use languages in private anyway.

If you know a quick way to implement languages/FODs in the current Windows 10 ISO (I don't want to search for language/FOD ISOs that i cannot get without a license).
